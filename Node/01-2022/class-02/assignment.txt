1. Create an array of sports people. Each object should have an id, name, sport and age.

2. Create full CRUD capabilities for the array, using separate functions. (In a separate file.)

3. Export the functions from said file.

4. Import all functions in a main app file.

5. Inside the main app file, chain several functions in order 
    - Add a new sportsman to the array
    - Edit an existing member
    - Delete another existing member
    - Read the new state of the array
    (Hint: The above should be done by chaining promises)
