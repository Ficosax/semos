In order to connect to a MongoDB database we require the following:

1. A Mongo Atlas Cluster
2. Connection String
3. MongoDB Driver for Node (Standard or Mongoose)
4. Compass or Robo3T

HOW TO:

1. Create a Mongo Atlas account (https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Once there, create a new Cluster. Select Shared Tier, an Europe server and the M-0 tier (free-tier)
3. It will take a couple of minutes to set up the cluster, during which time we can configure the network access and db users.
4. Create a DB user in the tab database access. This will be a different user than the one we use to log in to Mongo. Grant atleast read/write any database privileges.
5. Open the Network access tab and add your IP address.
6. Once the cluster is setup, click on the Connect button, select connect your application. This will give you a connection string.
7. Use the connection string in Compass and Robo3T. Remember to change <password> with your actual password.
8. In order to connect via a Node App, we will need dotenv and mongoose via npm install.
9. Inside the .env file, add your connection string. e.g. MONGO_URI=connectionstring
10. Create a db.js file, inside, import the mongoose library. Create a wrapper function (async). Inside just type await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
11. Import the function inside your server.js file and call it. Use .then() and .catch()
