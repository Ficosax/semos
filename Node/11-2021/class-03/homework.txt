Create an HTTP Server.
Install Express and configure it.
Create a Router with two routes in it: 
    /posts that returns an array of objects as response (GET method)
    /posts that adds a post to the array of object (POST method)

BONUS

Instead of having the objects in memory, use filesystem to write to a file and read from a file.
