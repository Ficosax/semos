Create an application for ToDos

A single todo has the following properties: title, description, isCompleted

Implement full CRUD using redux for todos. 
Meaning, ability to create a new todo (C), place all todos in a list (R), edit a todo (U), delete a todo (D).

Create a login state (using either context or redux) that shows the add, edit and delete actions if a user is logged in.


BONUS

Create a login screen and a register screen. These two paths should be the only ones available if a user is not logged in.
Use JWT and localStorage to handle the login session.
Create your own Node backend to handle both the todo data and the login state.
